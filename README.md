# Code to replicate Figures in "Latent Signal Models: Learning Compact Representations of Signal Evolution for Improved Time-Resolved, Multi-contrast MRI"

Written by Yamin Arefeen.  Please feel free to contact me and ask questions through email: yarefeen@mit.edu.

Latent Signal Models combines ideas from Bloch-equation based techniques, linear subspace constraints, and latent representations of signal for improved time-resolved MRI reconstruction.

Data for Figures 3-7 can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5upn7121m0dxvjp/AAD2liymnq4LhNKs85nUddJya?dl=0.
