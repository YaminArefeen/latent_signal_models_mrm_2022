## Running the Experiment

Be sure to download the data from the dropbox link and move it into a folder titled **data/**

#### 1. Simulating k-space

Run the Matlab script **prepare_t2_shuffling.m** to generate t2-shuffling k-space for reconstruction.

#### 2. Comparing linear and proposed reconstructions.

Run the notebook **reconstruction_script.ipynb** to perform proposed and linear reconstructions on the t2-shuffling k-space.
